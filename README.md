# Fe_Genie_HMMs

Hidden Markov Models for FeGenie (https://github.com/Arkadiy-Garber/FeGenie) used to search for _Geobacter_-like multiheme-cytochromes. HMMs for CbcA, CbcB, CbcL, ExtA, ExtB, ExtC, and ExtD are included, along with the alignment files used to generate the HMMs. To use the HMMs, move the files into their matching location within the iron_recuction hmm folder of FeGenie (Ex. /fegenie-1.2/hmms/iron/iron_reduction/). Either replace the HMM-bitcutoffs.txt file within the iron/ folder or append the desired HMMs to the existing file.
